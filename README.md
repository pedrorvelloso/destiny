# Destiny

Destiny is a donation tracker for speedruns/gaming charity events.

## Development

To start developing install dependencies, start DB docker and set environment variables

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# start docker db
docker-compose up db

# set env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Then start development server

```sh
yarn start:dev

# if you want to run with debug
yarn start:dev:debug
```

If it's all good you should see the following output
```sh
ðŸš€ Listening on port 3333
ðŸ”‰ Listening Streamlabs
```

Server now should be listening at `http://localhost:3333` (or .env port you set)

## Tests

All server Services should be tested. To run tests run `yarn test`

## Deploy

You can build everything with `yarn build` and deploy wherever you want

### Docker

If you want to use Docker you can build the `Dockerfile` or run `docker-compose.yml`.

```sh
# running with docker-compose.yml
docker-compose build app

docker-compose up -d # this will also start db service :)
```
